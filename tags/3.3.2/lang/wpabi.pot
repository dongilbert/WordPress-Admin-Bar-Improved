msgid "When you enable this option, you will get a new location added to your \"Theme Locations\" box on your Appearance -> Menus admin page called \"Admin Bar Improved.\" Use this as you would any other menu location for your site. Create a new menu on the Menus admin page, and name it whatever you'd like, just keep it easy to identify. Add whatever items to that menu that you want. Nested menu items will work as expected. When you're finished, select the menu you created from the select list under the \"Admin Bar Improved\" theme location. Once completed, (and once you refresh the page, or navigate to another page) you will see that the items you added are now in your admin bar. Good job!"
